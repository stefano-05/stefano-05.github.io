    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Isabella Stefano. I am a sophomore at CUA majoring in Criminology and minoring in Social Work. 
        There are many different units in my major, but after graduation I plan on earning my master's degree in Forensic Science. 
        I am taking this course as a requirement for my Criminology major. This course will give future employers the opportunity 
        to see that I have experience with AI concepts. In addition to this course, I am also taking SOC 256: The World of AI, 
        which explores both coding and the ethical questions surrounding artificial intelligence.
