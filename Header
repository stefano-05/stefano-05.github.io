#Isabella Stefano Intro to AI (AI 109)
Hello, my name is Isabella Stefano. I am a Sophmore at CUA majoring in Criminolgy and minoring in Social Works! 
There are many different units in my major but hopefully when I do graduate I plan on getting my masters in Forensic Science. 
I am taking this course is because it is for one of my requirments as a Crimoinology major. 
This will give jobs the oppurtunity to know that I took an AI course. On top of taking this course, 
I also take another course on AI called SOC 256, The World of AI. The course also involves some coding but it also navigates the moral ethics of AI in general, 
wether if it is good or bad. I enjoy taking this course. Be sure to check out my account linked here! ->
