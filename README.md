# AI 109 – Personal Course Website

**Website URL**
https://stefano-05.github.io

**Purpose**
This website serves as my personal course page for Intro to AI and will host my future JavaScript game project in Part 2.

**AI Usage**
I used ChatGPT to help draft the SDLC documents (README, DESIGN, and TESTING) and to generate an initial structure for the website content. I provided the assignment requirements and prompted AI to generate drafts for each file. I then reviewed and edited all materials to ensure the site would be displayed with the parameters I intended to set. Where AI helped me the most was with the design of the html file which is used to make the page look easier to read, less plain, and even includes some design features to make the page look more aesthetically interesting.
