# AI 109 - Personal Course Website
https://stefano-05.github.io

#Purpose
This website is my personal page for this class where I will host future projects and class materials. In the future I will host a Javascript game on this site!

#Note on AI Usage
I used ChatGPT to draft the SDLC documents (README, DESIGN, & TESTING) and to create a general structure for the website. I did this by prompting AI with the assignment handout. Using the drafts provided by AI I used these to complete the digital construction of this website.
