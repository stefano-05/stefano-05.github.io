# Isabella Stefano Intro to AI
Hello, My name is Isabella Stefano. I am in my Sophmore year of college and I am majoring in Criminolgy and minoring in Social Works. The reason why I am taking this course is because it is for one of my requirments as a Crimoinology major. I honestly think the reason why the adminstartion did this was because there is a growing learning in AI and a lot of Crimonology jobs do use some form of computer programming. There are many different units in my major but hopefully when I do graduate I plan on getting my masters in Forensic Science. This will give jobs the oppurtunity to know that I took an AI course. On top of taking this course, I also take an other course on AI as well called SOC 256, The World of AI. The course also involves some coding but it also navigates the moral ethics of AI in general, wether if it is good or bad. To be honest, I believe that AI is a good inventions but like all intentions, it can be used against the human knowledge which can be bad. Overall, This is just my outlook of it. I enjoy taking this course. Be sure to check out my account linked here! ->
