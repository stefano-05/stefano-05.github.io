# Design plan

**Structure Outline**

1. Header
  - My name
  - "Intro to AI" or "AI 109"

2. About Section
   - Short paragraph introducing myself (3–6 sentences)

3. Projects Section
   - Placeholder for Project 1, Part 2: JavaScript Game (Coming Soon)
   - Link to my GitHub profile

## Layout Choices

I chose a single-page layout with vertical scrolling. Each section is clearly separated using headings. The navigation is simple and structured so that users can quickly identify the About and Projects sections. The layout is responsive so it works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Design Rationale

I chose a single-page design in order to prioritize site cleanliness. Since this project is focused on basic development over complex links or functions, I put emphasis clarity and readability. This assists with issues related to readibility. Additionally, this organization style easily allows me to add the JavaScript game in Part 2 without redesigning the entire site.
